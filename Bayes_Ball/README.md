# Bayes Ball

Algorthim to identify indepencies efficiently in Bayesian Network

# Synopsis

Implemented the Bayes Ball algorithm for computing the set of 

1)d-separated nodes

2)Requisite probability nodes

3)Requisite observation nodes

in Belief Networks(bayesian networks) using the [Bayes Ball algorthim](http://www.wikicoursenote.com/wiki/Stat946f11#Bayes_Ball)
