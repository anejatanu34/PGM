# Bayes Ball

Algorthim to identify independencies efficiently in Bayesian Network

# Synopsis

Implemented the Bayes Ball algorithm for computing the set of 

1. d-separated nodes

2. Requisite probability nodes

3. Requisite observation nodes

in Belief Networks(bayesian networks) using the [Bayes Ball algorthim](http://www.wikicoursenote.com/wiki/Stat946f11#Bayes_Ball)
