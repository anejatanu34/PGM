# OCR Model - Exhaustive Inference

OCR Model Representation and Exhaustive Inference on undirected graphical Models

# Synopsis

Implemented the OCR Model and Exhaustive Inference queries are calculated

Three type of models are created

1. Basic OCR model

2. OCR + Transition Model

3. OCR + transition + Skip Model

and Exhaustive Inference was done to know accuracies of the model using various metrics

For Results go to [results](https://github.com/saivig/PGM/tree/master/OCR-Exh_Inference/results) folder

Overview of results can be found [here](https://github.com/saivig/PGM/blob/master/OCR-Exh_Inference/Docs/Observations.pdf)
