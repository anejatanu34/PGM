Some Algorthims I had implemented for Probability Graphical Models course at IIT - Delhi

1. Bayes Ball - To identify indepencies and active trails

2. Exhaustive Inference and Model Creation of OCR - character recognition

3. Gibbs Sampling (a MCMC algorthim) - for Approximate inference on large datasets on advanced OCR Model
